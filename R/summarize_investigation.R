# 1. Municipality Count Issue
cat("1. MUNICIPALITY COUNT DISCREPANCY:\n")
cat("   FINDING: The inflated count (8,085) was due to counting municipality name variations\n")
cat("   REALITY: There are 5,571 unique municipality codes (matches expected ~5,570)\n")

# 2. Temporal Consistency
cat("2. TEMPORAL CONSISTENCY:\n")

# 3. Zero Stations in All Years
cat("3. POLLING STATIONS PERSISTENCE:\n")
cat("   FINDING: Zero individual stations appear in all years\n")

cat("   EVIDENCE:\n")
cat("   - local_ids are simple integers (1, 2, 3...)\n")
cat("   - Each year has unique IDs starting from 1\n")

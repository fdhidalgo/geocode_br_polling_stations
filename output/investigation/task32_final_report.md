# Task 32: Final Report - Brasília in Municipal Election Data

## Executive Summary
Investigation revealed that Brasília's presence in 2008/2012 municipal election data is **not an error**, but rather reflects TSE's practice of maintaining comprehensive polling station infrastructure data regardless of election type.

## Key Findings

### 1. Data Analysis Results
- **523 polling stations** in Brasília for 2008
- **579 polling stations** in Brasília for 2012
- Most stations (383 out of 818) appear continuously across all years
- Only 9 stations appear exclusively in what seem to be "municipal years" (but likely due to opening/closing dates)
- **331 stations** had address updates across years, confirming active maintenance

### 2. Root Cause
The TSE maintains a unified polling station database that:
- Tracks all polling infrastructure year-round
- Updates station information during any election cycle
- Does not distinguish between election types in the raw data

### 3. Evidence Supporting Infrastructure Hypothesis
- **Continuous presence**: Most stations appear in both federal/state AND municipal years
- **Address updates**: Regular updates to station addresses indicate ongoing maintenance
- **Station evolution**: Clear patterns of stations opening, closing, and being replaced over time

## Recommendations

### 1. Immediate Actions
No data correction needed - the data accurately reflects TSE's infrastructure records.

### 2. Implementation Options

#### Option A: Add Documentation (Recommended)
Document this behavior in the project README and data dictionary:
```markdown
**Note on Special Districts**: Brasília (DF) and Fernando de Noronha (PE) 
appear in all election years despite not holding municipal elections. 
This reflects TSE's infrastructure maintenance practices, not actual voting.
```

#### Option B: Add Optional Filtering
Implement the `filter_election_appropriate()` function (already created) to allow users to:
- Filter out non-voting records
- Add flags for election appropriateness
- Maintain full traceability

#### Option C: Add Metadata Fields
Enhance the dataset with:
- `election_type`: Municipal/Federal/State
- `jurisdiction_type`: Municipality/Federal District/State District
- `election_appropriate`: Boolean flag

### 3. Pipeline Integration
If filtering is desired, add to `_targets.R`:
```r
tar_target(
  name = locais_filtered,
  command = filter_election_appropriate(
    locais_cleaned,
    keep_all = TRUE  # Adds flags instead of removing
  )
)
```

## Files Created
1. `/R/filter_election_appropriate.R` - Filtering functions
2. `/tests/testthat/test-election-appropriateness.R` - Unit tests
3. `/R/verify_brasilia_hypothesis.R` - Detailed analysis script
4. Investigation reports in `/output/investigation/`

## Conclusion
The presence of Brasília in 2008/2012 data is a **feature, not a bug**. It accurately represents how TSE maintains its polling station infrastructure. Any filtering should be optional and well-documented to preserve data integrity.

**Recommendation**: Close this task as resolved with documentation update.

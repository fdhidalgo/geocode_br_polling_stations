- Files partially cleaned: 10 
- Files kept as-is: 1
- Files created: 2 (pipeline_config.R, validation_stages.R)

## Duplicate Functions Resolved
1. ✅ `filter_by_dev_mode` - Removed from target_helpers.R, kept in filtering_helpers.R
2. ✅ `clean_cnefe10` - Removed from data_cleaning_fns.R, kept memory-efficient version in memory_efficient_cnefe.R

Note: The other 6 functions listed were not actually duplicates after investigation:
- The string matching functions only exist in string_matching_geocode_fns.R (the memory_efficient file was moved to backup)
- The normalize functions don't exist in the codebase

## Progress Log

### 2025-06-18
- Created tracking document
- Identified 140 unused functions across 31 files
- Prioritized files with 0% usage for initial cleanup
- Moved 15 files with 0% usage to project_backup/R/:
  - brasilia_all.R
  - column_mapping.R
  - data_quality_monitor_v2.R
  - filter_brasilia_municipal.R
  - state_filtering.R
  - string_matching_geocode_fns_memory_efficient.R
  - string_matching_selector.R
  - target_factories.R
  - target_factory.R
  - update_validation_for_brasilia.R
  - validate_brasilia_filtering.R
  - validation_all.R
  - validation_pipeline_stages.R
  - validation_report_renderer.R
  - validation_reporting.R
- Fixed pipeline after initial cleanup:
  - Created get_crew_controllers() in target_helpers.R
  - Extracted used functions from state_filtering.R to pipeline_config.R
  - Pipeline now loads successfully (85 targets)
- Cleaned files with partial usage:
  - data_cleaning_fns.R: Removed 1 unused function (process_multiple_cnefe)
  - data_table_utils.R: Moved 3 of 5 functions to backup
  - filtering_helpers.R: Moved 4 of 11 functions to backup
  - expected_municipality_counts.R: Kept all (100% usage)
  - functions_validate.R: Moved all functions (only used in tests)
  - geocodebr_matching.R: Moved 2 of 5 functions to backup
  - Pipeline still working correctly
- Resolved duplicate functions:
  - Removed filter_by_dev_mode from target_helpers.R (kept filtering_helpers.R version)
  - Removed clean_cnefe10 from data_cleaning_fns.R (kept memory_efficient_cnefe.R version)
  - Verified other reported duplicates didn't exist
- Fixed pipeline after cleanup:
  - Created validation_stages.R with core validation functions from backup
  - Added convert_coord function back to data_cleaning_fns.R
  - Updated configure_targets_options to include 'validate' package
  - Fixed dev mode filtering to use correct column name (estado_abrev)
- **Pipeline tested and working**: All 85 targets present, validation targets pass
- Fixed additional dev mode errors (2025-06-18 after cleanup):
  - Added sf package to tar_option_set packages list
  - Fixed tract_shp and muni_shp targets to use braces for proper evaluation
  - Fixed apply_dev_mode_filters to use correct state column for muni_ids
  - **Pipeline now fully functional in dev mode**

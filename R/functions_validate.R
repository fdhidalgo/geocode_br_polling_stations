# Validation Functions using the validate package
# 
# This file is currently a placeholder. The validation functions originally
# defined here (create_muni_ids_rules, validate_muni_ids_data, etc.) were
# not used in the main pipeline and have been moved to:
# project_backup/R/unused_validate_functions.R
#
# The actual validation functions used in the pipeline are referenced in
# R/validation_target_functions.R and appear to be defined elsewhere.
#
# This file is kept to maintain compatibility with any imports that might
# expect it to exist.

# Note: If you need the original validation functions, they can be found in:

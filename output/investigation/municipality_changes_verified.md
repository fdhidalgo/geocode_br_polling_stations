## 2. Brasília (DF) Election Pattern - Confirmed and Explained

### Why Brasília appears in 2008 and 2012 data:
This needs further investigation as these are municipal election years when DF should NOT have elections. Possible explanations:
1. Data collection error
2. Special district elections being miscategorized
3. Administrative regions elections being counted

### Missing from 2016, 2020, 2024:
This is CORRECT - Brasília should not appear in these municipal election years.

### ✅ State District, Not Municipality
- **Status**: State district of Pernambuco

## Conclusions

1. **All new municipalities are legitimate** - Created through proper legal processes with plebiscites
2. **Installation delays were common** - Due to constitutional challenges at STF level
3. **Brasília's pattern is partially correct** - Should NOT appear in any municipal election years

3. **No corrections needed**: For the new municipalities - they appear at the correct times
4. **Consider adding metadata**: Include municipality creation dates in reference data

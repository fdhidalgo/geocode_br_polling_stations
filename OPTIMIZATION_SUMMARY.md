# Pipeline Optimization Summary

## Implemented Optimizations

### 1. **Increased Worker Count** (R/target_helpers.R)
- **Before**: 2 workers (dev) / 4 workers (prod)
- **After**: 8 workers (dev) / 28 workers (prod)
- **Impact**: Better utilization of 32-core machine

### 2. **Reduced Batch Size** (_targets.R:622)
- **Before**: 10 municipalities/batch (dev) / 50 (prod)
- **After**: 5 municipalities/batch (dev) / 15 (prod)
- **Impact**: Creates ~370 batches in production (vs ~111), keeping all 28 workers busy

### 3. **Dual Controller Architecture** (R/target_helpers.R)
- **Standard Controller**: 28 workers for general tasks
- **Memory-Limited Controller**: 8 workers for CNEFE operations
- **Impact**: Prevents memory exhaustion on memory-intensive tasks

### 4. **Controller Assignment by Task Type**
Applied memory_limited controller to:
- `cnefe22_stbairro_match_batch`
- `cnefe10_stbairro_match_batch`
- `agrocnefe_stbairro_match_batch`
- `schools_cnefe22_match_batch`
- `schools_cnefe10_match_batch`

### 5. **Smart Batching Already Enabled**
- The code already supports size-based batching via `municipality_sizes`
- Large municipalities get smaller batch sizes automatically

## Expected Performance Improvements

With these optimizations:
- **Worker utilization**: From 12.5% (4/32 cores) to 87.5% (28/32 cores)
- **Batch parallelism**: 3.7x more batches for better load distribution
- **Memory efficiency**: Dedicated controller prevents OOM on large municipalities
- **Expected speedup**: 3-5x faster pipeline execution

## Next Steps

1. Run the pipeline with `DEV_MODE = FALSE` to test full production performance
2. Monitor memory usage with `htop` during execution
3. Check `tar_meta()` after completion for actual runtime improvements
4. Fine-tune batch sizes if needed based on results

## Running the Optimized Pipeline

```bash
# Clean previous runs
R -e "targets::tar_destroy()"

# Run full pipeline
R -e "targets::tar_make()"

# Monitor progress
R -e "targets::tar_progress()"
```
